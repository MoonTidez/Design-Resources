# Personal UI/UX Design Resource List

Over the past 3 years of self-learning UI & UX design, the internet has been my primary source of information. Below, you can find a list of the resources I found useful (and I hope you do too).

## Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

When designing for Apple devices, it is best that designers refer to Apple's HIG for guidance and resources. This allows designers to create consistent experiences that are not only consistent with the platform itself (iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS, etc.) but also consistent across platforms. In addition to this, it provides an insight to Apple's own design philosophies. I have personally learnt a lot from this resource, such as details regarding the use of hyphens, grammar and capitalization inside of interfaces. 

Access Apple's Human Interface Guidelines via [this link](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/). It includes resources for designing specifically for [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/designing-for-ios), [iPadOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/designing-for-ipados), [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/designing-for-macos), [tvOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/designing-for-tvos) and [watchOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/platforms/designing-for-watchos).

## Femke Design

This is a great channel for those more proficient in UI/UX design. Along with insights on her product design career, Femke also posts videos on her design process and dealing with product managers. Her channel can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/femkedesign). Furthermore, she also provides paid memberships to her design community on superpeer. You can find more information regarding this [here](https://www.femke.design/community). 

## # Michal Malewicz 

Malewicz is a UI/UX designer with tons of experience, designing interfaces since the early 2000s. He is a founder of [Hype4](https://hype4.com/), a design studio for digital products. He is known for kickstarting some of the most popular UI trends, including neumorphism, glassmorphism, Aurora UI.

Malewicz posts videos about design on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/MalewiczHype). These are helpful to gain small bits of information about UI design, and also regarding how the UI/UX design market is going. In addition to this, he has written a few books about UI/UX design, most notably his [No bullshit guide to UX](https://hype4academy.gumroad.com/l/guidetoux) and [Designing User Interfaces](https://www.designingui.com/). He also has [other books](), two of which are free. If you prefer video resources, you can check out his [video courses](https://hype4.academy/video-courses). Lastly, he frequently posts blogs/articles on his [Medium](https://michalmalewicz.medium.com/) and [Hype4 Academy](https://hype4.academy/articles) website.

## Design Tokens

> Design tokens are a methodology for expressing design decisions in a platform-agnostic way so that they can be shared across different disciplines, tools, and technologies. They help establish a common vocabulary across organizations. 

\- [The W3C Design Tokens Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/design-tokens)

Over the past year, big corporations have rapidly shifted towards a methodology incorporating design tokens and/or its principles. Examples of design systems shifting towards tokenization include [Adobe's Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/), Figma's Design System (see their [blog post](https://www.figma.com/blog/illuminating-dark-mode/)),  IBM's [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/), Salesforce's [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/), and Uber's [Base Web](https://baseweb.design/). Atlassian is also currently in the process of incorporating design tokens into its [design system](https://atlassian.design/foundations/color).

Below, I have included a list of resources to understand design tokens. You can also refer to the design systems themselves that incorporate design tokens to see how they are used in practice.
